Description:
    wERLd (named "win" in Spawnfest 2012) is a project aimed at creating a
backend for the BrowserQuest game. BrowserQuest is a HTML5/JavaScript
multiplayer game created as a proof of concept of a game running entirely on
HTML5 and JS without requiring flash. It can be played in Firefox, Chrome,
Safari, Opera, and runs on iOS and Android. It communicates with the server
via websockets. 

The default BrowserQuest server is written in Node.js. As the only
communication between the client and server takes place through websockets,
we wanted to reverse-engineer the server by looking at the source code in
combination with actively looking at what the client sent through the websocket
at game startup, and from there implement the required server functionality.

During the Spawnfest 2012 competition, we managed to implement some of the map
functionality, player movement, mobs and player-mob fighting. The final
Spawnfest 2012 submission is taged as a git tag in the repo.

We aim to maintain a stable master branch of the backend repo, and welcome
pull requests. Future plans include supporting items, static entities such as
NPCs and quests.
